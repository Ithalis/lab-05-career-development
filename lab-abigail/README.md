## Description
This repository contains prototypes for array methods, including `forEach()`, `filter()`, `pop()`, `push()`, `map()`, `reduce()`, and `copy()`. Unit tests were added to confirm prototype functionality and each test was defined with a Big-O runtime.

## Directions
1. Install dependencies with `npm i` in your Terminal.
2. Run tests by running `npm run test`.
